This project is about building a PRM : Personal Relationship Manager. 
Basically a way to remember things about friends and family. 
The FE is a Mobile App, Expo Router, React Native, Typescript. 
The BE is a Gin Server, written in Golang. The API endpoints are authenticated
using Clerk. We're currently using Postgres as our DB. 
We're also using Nativewind in order to handle RN styling. Components are in src/_components in the Frontend directory. We use ShadCN UI and Base UI as the layer below. Lucide icons for react native. 

The BE is written in the server/ directory and FE is written in the 
frontend/ directory. We use an ORM called ent in order to handle the DB entities.
